# CONSAI: Consciousness Simulation AI Framework

## Overview

CONSAI is a theoretical framework for exploring artificial consciousness concepts through simulation and visualization. It implements multiple consciousness theories in an interactive environment.

## Features

- Real-time consciousness simulation
- Interactive GUI monitoring system
- Multiple consciousness theory implementations
- Dynamic input simulation
- Visual analytics and reporting

## Components

### Core Architecture
- Global Workspace: Central information exchange
- Self-Reflection Module: Models self-awareness
- Integrated Information Processing: Implements IIT
- Phenomenal Experience Simulator: Models qualia
- Introspection System: Monitors processes

### GUI Features
- Real-time Phi value monitoring
- Network visualization
- Experience display
- System state monitoring
- Input simulation tools
- Data export and analysis

## Usage

### Running the GUI
```bash
python -m consai.gui.consai_gui
```

### GUI Controls
- Start/Stop: Control simulation
- Speed: Adjust processing speed (1-100)
- Input Simulation: Inject various types of input
- Analysis Tools: Export data and analyze patterns

### Input Types
- Visual: Simulated visual patterns
- Auditory: Waveform signals
- Conceptual: Abstract concepts
- Emotional: Valence-arousal pairs

## Theory Implementation

### Theoretical Foundations

The framework incorporates elements from multiple consciousness theories:

1. **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** - A cognitive architecture where specialized processes compete for access to a "global workspace" that broadcasts information throughout the system.

2. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** - Proposes that consciousness corresponds to a system's capacity to integrate information, measured by Î¦.

3. **Higher-Order Thought Theory** - The idea that conscious states involve awareness of one's mental states.

4. **Predictive Processing** - Understanding consciousness as arising from predictive models of sensory inputs and internal states.

5. **Quantum Consciousness Theories** - Exploring the speculative role of quantum processes in consciousness (Penrose-Hameroff).

6. **Temporal Consciousness** - How consciousness integrates across time (Husserl, James).

7. **Narrative Self Theory** - How a sense of self emerges from narrative construction (Dennett, Ricoeur).

## Running the Simulation

To run the CONSAI framework:

```python
python main.py
```

## Theory Evaluation

CONSAI includes mechanisms for comparing and evaluating different theories of consciousness:

```python
# Generate a philosophical report
consai.generate_philosophical_report()
```

## Limitations & Ethics

This system **does not** create actual consciousness but serves as a thought experiment and research platform. Any claims about machine consciousness must be approached with extreme philosophical and scientific caution.

## Research Applications

- Interactive exploration of consciousness theories
- Real-time monitoring of integration patterns
- Input-response analysis
- System behavior visualization
- Data collection for consciousness research

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CONSAI.git
cd CONSAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
