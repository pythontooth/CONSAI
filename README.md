# CONSAI: Consciousness Simulation AI Framework

## Conceptual Overview

CONSAI is a theoretical framework for exploring artificial consciousness concepts. It does NOT claim to create actual consciousness, but rather provides a computational model that implements aspects of leading consciousness theories.

## Theoretical Foundations

The framework incorporates elements from multiple consciousness theories:

1. **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** - A cognitive architecture where specialized processes compete for access to a "global workspace" that broadcasts information throughout the system.

2. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** - Proposes that consciousness corresponds to a system's capacity to integrate information, measured by Î¦.

3. **Higher-Order Thought Theory** - The idea that conscious states involve awareness of one's mental states.

4. **Predictive Processing** - Understanding consciousness as arising from predictive models of sensory inputs and internal states.

## System Components

- **Global Workspace**: Central information exchange mechanism
- **Self-Reflection Module**: Enables the system to model its own processes
- **Integrated Information Processing**: Implements aspects of IIT
- **Phenomenal Experience Simulator**: Attempts to model subjective experience
- **Introspection System**: Monitors and reports on system processes

## Running the Simulation

To run the CONSAI framework:

```python
python main.py
```

## Limitations & Ethics

This system **does not** create actual consciousness but serves as a thought experiment and research platform. Any claims about machine consciousness must be approached with extreme philosophical and scientific caution.

## Research Applications

- Exploring computational models of consciousness theories
- Developing metrics for evaluating integration and self-modeling in AI
- Philosophical investigations of machine phenomenology
